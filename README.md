# wind_generated_power
This repository contains some jupiter notebook which I made for Hacker Earth's wind generated power competition.

For further information about this competition's objective, visit https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-windmill-power/

I made these notebooks using Anaconda.

Thank you.
